JsonClassified
==============

A JSON class generator.

Usage:
./generator.php \<file|url\> \<template Java|Php|Csharp\> \<initial classname\> \<outputdir\>

If you, like me, enjoy strongly typed classes when working with JSON.
This little utility will generate the boilerplate code for you, from a JSON file or URL.

It's not perfect, but it will get you 95% of the way 95% of the time ;)

Currently supported language templates:
 * Java
 * PHP
 * C#

Custom templates are easy to make. Just have a look at one of the template scripts, and customize it or create a new one.
If you do create a new template, or simply have suggestions for a better standard template,
then go ahead and make a pull request, and I'll throw it in there :)

Enjoy.
